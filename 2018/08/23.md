# QRL Dev Meeting 23rd August 2018

Present: KKS/AC/MK/AK/AB/JM

## Exchange integration
[redacted discussion]

## Wallet Daemon API
- Changes in Wallet Daemon API to automate things like Slave Transaction, so that exchanges can easily integrate mainnet

## Last OTS index thought/ideas
- Have slave trees be deterministically generated
- To avoid lock up due to consumption of all signatures, we may add restriction to protocol, such that accounts with last X OTS keys can only make slave transactions

## Documentation
- Updating the API and docs site to reflect Kaushal's changes with walletAPI 

## Smaller developments
- Working on building a faucet to give qrl away, may be tied into a tip-bot as well 
- Discussion with Jack starting some more videos to cover basic concepts like OTS keys and using QRL tools like the web wallet and explorer

## Smart Contracts (Project Carbon)
- Work in progress with data-types and expression statements

## Mobile Wallet
- Main view of the mobile app done: it shows the balance and last 10 tx 
- Backup view done: shows the hexseed and mnemonic to the user 
- Working on sending the first tx from mobile

## BECH32
- Conversion and equality function in webwallet
