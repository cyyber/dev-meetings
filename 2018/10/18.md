Apologies: JPL

## 1. Exchange integration
[redacted discussion]

## 2. grpc api issues
- Changes in progress to modify address state api calls to paginate output to get around 4mb grpc limit.
- Requires changes to Public API and WalletDaemon but will not effect third party integration.
- Structural optimisations being implemented to leveldb to massively improve performance for data heavy addresses.
- Discussion around preventing subtle state bugs, importance of lengthy testing, integration tests and fork recovery / roll back state code checks.

## 3. Web Wallet
- Good progress moving web wallet to vuejs, utilising grpc web, and removing server side implementation so far.
- Working prototype expected in two weeks.
- MK and SD meeting in Amsterdam next week to run over details of new wallet design parameters.

## 4. Go-QRL 
- Changes in State & AddressState Optimisation
- Unit tests for chain and state in progress.

## 5. Multi-sig
- PWW discussed adding multi-sig via two new transaction subtypes.
