# QRL Dev Meeting 20th December
Present: JPL/PWW/KKS/JG/AB/MK/JM/AK

## 1. Exchange integration
[redacted discussion]

## 2. Go-QRL
- Logging improved
- Unit testing for transaction pool complete, fixing the issue of crash  while checking the transaction pool as the config was not initialised.
- Miner code has been added into Go-QRL along with the associated unit tests. This supports solo mining.
- Mining API that supports mining pool added.
- Test suite for API put together: mining pool works well with Go-QRL.
- Implementation of transfer API is still pending (used to payout the miners) with the plan to implement this with the automatic slave maintenance we put together for exchange integration.

## 3. Ledger integration
- Workaround to 1.5 dependency complete: we are no longer dependent on this and Ledger app is ready for release, subject to internal QA.
- Web wallet functionality is now complete
- Demonstration of transactions to team prior to further internal testing and QA.
- Few UX tweaks to web wallet in progress
- Documentation, internal team testing over the holiday season and Ledger review shortly thereafter: perhaps by the end of the year or (very) early 2019.

## 4. Explorer
- Re-theme launched: some ongoing tweaks as visualised
- Basic caching complete
- Initial JSON API implemented to allow external projects to easily hook into the QRL blockchain.

## 5. [redacted] & QRL integration
[redacted discussion]

## 6. Mobile wallet
- Awaiting community feedback
